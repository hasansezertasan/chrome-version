## Installation

``` bash
uv add chrome-version
```

## Usage

Module:

```python
import chrome_version
print(chrome_version.get_chrome_version())

```

CLI:

```bash
chrome-version
103.0.5060.114
```

## Motivation

TL;DR I don't want to copy and paste it again...

At first,

I needed to get the Chrome version for a project I was working on, which was using [Undetected Chromedriver][undetected-chromedriver]. I found [this gist][chrome-version-gist].

After using it in several projects, I decided to turn it into a module so I'll be free of copy/paste. It only have one functionality: getting the chrome version.

Then,

I decided to use this package to learn more about:

- Using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for packaging and dependency management.
- Using scripts for CLI.
- Versioning.
- License management.
- Documentation.
- Publishing a module on PyPI.
- Using GitHub Actions to automate the publishing process.
- ...

Finally,

Now it's kind of a playground for me to learn more...

One other thing is that it's educational: A simple module is a good practice for me to learn how to build modules and publish them on PyPI and show others how easy it is.

```

The commands below can also be executed using the [xc task runner](https://xcfile.dev/), which combines the usage instructions with the actual commands. Simply run `xc`, it will popup an interactive menu with all available tasks.

### `pre-commit`

Run the pre-commit hooks:

```sh
uvx pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage manual --show-diff-on-failure
```

### `checks`

Run all checks to ensure code quality:

```sh
uvx "validate-pyproject[all]" pyproject.toml
uvx typos
uvx vulture src
uvx ruff check
uvx taplo lint pyproject.toml
uvx ruff format
uvx taplo format pyproject.toml
uvx mypy src
uvx mypy --install-types --non-interactive src/chrome_version
```

### `docs:serve`

Serve the documentation locally:

```sh
uvx --with-requirements requirements.docs.txt --reinstall mkdocs serve
```

### `docs:build`
